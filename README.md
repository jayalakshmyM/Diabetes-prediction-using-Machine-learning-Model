# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a **Machine Learning model** that can predict whether a patient is at risk of diabetes based on their health data. The aim is to assist in **early diagnosis and preventive healthcare** by using predictive analytics on patient records.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To preprocess patient health data for training.  
- To explore multiple ML algorithms for classification.  
- To evaluate and compare model performance.  
- To build a reliable model for early diabetes prediction.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- The dataset contains patient health-related features such as:  
  - **Pregnancies**  
  - **Glucose Level**  
  - **Blood Pressure**  
  - **Skin Thickness**  
  - **Insulin**  
  - **BMI**  
  - **Diabetes Pedigree Function**  
  - **Age**  
  - **Outcome** (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## ⚙️ Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Normalization/Standardization of features  
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing sets  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Implemented and compared multiple algorithms:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Random Forest  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
     - Decision Tree  
     - XGBoost (optional for boosting performance)  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score  
   - ROC-AUC Curve  

## 🚀 Results  
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **97%** (example – update with your actual result).  
- Random Forest and SVM showed strong classification performance.
